# Flashers
A FlashCard building/sharing social app, Built using MongoDB, GraphQL, Apollo Client, and React. I have been practicing my GraphQL approach by reading the documentation and working through tutorials. This still needs a lot of work, but I am happy to see progress and have enjoyed the learning process.
This code has been deployed, Backend was hosted on Heroku and the Frontend was hosted using Netlify. 

ToDo's:
1: Edit functionality, has not been worked on. 
2: Currently the FlashCards are not a flipping card, they use buttons to show hints and the answer, I hope to work out a better UX.
